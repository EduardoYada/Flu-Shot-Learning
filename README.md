## Objective 

This project is the final assignment for the Statistical Learning course held at University of SÃ£o Paulo and ministered by Florencia Leonardi. The purpose of this assignment is to put the techniques covered in the discipline into practice in a real world problem. Given the global pandemic situation we chose a competition regarding vaccination. 

Vaccination is a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. As of November 2020, vaccines for the COVID-19 virus are still not available. Therefore, this competition aims to revisit the public health response to another recent respiratory disease pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. A survey was conducted in the United States asking respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with questions about themselves. For more details check out the [competition link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/). The goal then is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.
